# hackathing

A basic Flutter project following their setup tutorial and first app tutorial.
[Flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs),

## Short description of what you attempted to build
I built a simple app that generates word pairs in an infinitely scrolling list. Each word pair has a heart beside it that you can tap, and hearted word pairs are saved in a separate view that you can access at the top right of the app.

I also built upon this base app from the tutorial by changing the theme colors and adding (tbd).

## What you learned
- I've never used React Native, so maybe it's not quite as amazing, but hot reloading is great!
- I learned a little Kotlin-- it seems very similar to python and easy to read, which is nice.
- Seems a *bit* sad but I learned how to make a local directory into a git-tracked directory using `git init`, since I had never had to do that before in any of my classes.

## What didnâ€™t work
- The setup was quite long and painful. It took me two days between setting up Java SDK, the Flutter specifics tools, and the Android simulator.
- I had a hard time getting the simulator to run for the first time, as I got stuck on a Gradle `assembleDebug` task. A quick Google fixed this but it just stalled and I didn't know how long I had to wait.
- I think I somehow bugged out my computer's fingerprint sensor while messing with the Windows settings to get the VM acceleration to work...
